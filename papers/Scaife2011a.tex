Showed with their ocean only simulations that the SST bias off Newfoundland is significantly alleviated by increasing the horizontal resolution (from 1\degree to 0.25\degree) (End of section 4) - maybe include in Intro \& Background too. The atmosphere only model provided mean bias and blocking error greatly alleviated at \textit{both} resolutions.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Shows importance of a resolved North Atlantic Current.
    \item Mentions the SST bias off Newfoundland.
    \item Uses NEMO 1\degree and 0.25\degree models.
    \item Same number of vertical levels in both.
    \item Highlights importance of accurate SSTs. Atlantic SSTs can affect surface baroclinicity, thermal winds and baroclinic eddy growth.
\end{itemize}
