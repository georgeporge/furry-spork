\begin{itemize}
    \item Good description of GS : passes through Strait of Florida then flows northward pressed against the confining wall of the southeastern U.S. continental shelf belfore leaving the slope at Cape Hatteras.
    \item GS path controlled by combination of boundary shape, bottom topography, entrainment of fluid from the gyre interior, and the adjustment of the flow tothe incrase in planetary vorticity as fluid is advected northward.
    \item cyclonic eddies propagate along the shelf (on the inshore side of the gulf Stream) - these are "frontal eddies" and occur where the Gulf Stream interacts with the slope and shelf.
\end{itemize}
