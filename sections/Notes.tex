\section*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Make lit review more specific - focus it on a few key papers rather than covering a ton of them!
	\item Focus on phenomenology rather than model stuff
	\item Add a section somewhere to explain bottom pressure torque and bottom vortex stretching - maybe in diagnostics secion but elsewhere too
	\item Maybe add in weird sandwhich scales phenomenology?
	\item Explain vertically integrated blah blah
	\item Find out a use for the vertical average info.
	\item Maybe discuss Sverdrup vs barotropic streamfunction transport? (see P2075 bottom right blue highlighted in Vallis \& Zhang 2007)
	\item Include how the energy is dissipated and where it goes when it hits the bottom - I think this was John T's q from my talk
	\item PHENOMENOLOGY
	\item What am I doing with the average?
\end{itemize}
