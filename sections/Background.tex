\section{Background}
Tell a story up to where we are and what's missing.
\subsection{Literature Review (take most from coursework).Cover the various angles including:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modelling \& vertical grid systems - include partial cells
  \item Turbulence and bathymetry - understanding the smaller processes (vorticity etc.) \citep{Tansley2001} \citep{Nikurashin2012a}
  \item Inclulde some phenomenology - e.g. bottom vortex stretching and bottom pressure torque. Maybe also the weird sandwhich diagram!
  \item Include context of climate modelling (e.g. Scaife et al, Ezer summary etc)
  \item context of what affects the Gulf Stream etc.
  \item Possible relationships/data sets to see the history of the Gulf Stream. (Palaeo?) \citep{Ezer2015}
  \item Cut down lit review - parts of it will be elsewhere!! (or should be! OR Remove them from elsewhere to keep them here!!)
\end{itemize}
