abstract = {Recent studies reported weakening in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and in the Gulf Stream (GS), using records of about a decade (RAPID project) or two (altimeter data). Coastal sea level records are much longer, so the possibility of detecting climatic changes in ocean circulation from sea level data is intriguing and thus been examined here. First, it is shown that variations in the AMOC transport from the RAPID project since 2004 are consistent with the flow between Bermuda and the U. S. coast derived from the Oleander measurements and from sea level difference (SLDIF). Despite apparent disagreement between recent studies on the ability of data to detect weakening in the GS flow, estimated transport changes from 3 different independent data sources agree quite well with each other on the extreme decline in transport in 2009-2010. Due to eddies and meandering, the flow representing the GS part of the Oleander line is not correlated with AMOC or with the Florida Current, only the flow across the entire Oleander line from the U.S. coast to Bermuda is correlated with climatic transport changes. Second, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) analysis shows that SLDIF can detect (with lag) the portion of the variations in the AMOC transport that are associated with the Florida Current and the wind-driven Ekman transport (SLDIF-transport correlations of {\~{}}. 0.7-0.9). The SLDIF has thus been used to estimate variations in transport since 1935 and compared with AMOC obtained from reanalysis data. The significant weakening in AMOC after {\~{}}. 2000 ({\~{}}. 4.5. Sv. per. decade) is comparable to weakening seen in the 1960s to early 1970s. Both periods of weakening AMOC, in the 1960s and 2000s, are characterized by faster than normal sea level rise along the northeastern U.S. coast, so monitoring changes in AMOC has practical implications for coastal protection.},

abstract = {In many global ocean climate models, mesoscale eddies are parameterized as along isopycnal diffusion and eddy-induced advection (or equivalently skew-diffusion). The eddy-induced advection flattens isopycnals and acts as a sink of available potential energy, whereas the isopycnal diffusion mixes tracers along neutral directions. While much effort has gone into estimating diffusivities associated with this closure, less attention has been paid to the details of how this closure (which tries to flatten isopycnals) interacts with the mixed layer (in which vertical mixing tries to drive the isopycnals vertical). In order to maintain numerical stability, models often stipulate a maximum slope Smax which in combination with the thickness diffusivity Agm defines a maximum eddy-induced advective transport Agm*Smax. In this paper, we examine the impact of changing Smax within the GFDL global coupled climate model. We show that this parameter produces significant changes in wintertime mixed layer depth, with implications for wintertime temperatures in key regions, the distribution of precipitation, and the vertical structure of heat uptake. Smaller changes are seen in details of ventilation and currents, and even smaller changes as regards the overall hydrography. The results suggest that not only the value of the coefficient, but the details of the tapering scheme, need to be considered when comparing isopycnal mixing schemes in models. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The ocean circulation is forced at a global scale by winds and fluxes of heat and fresh water. Kinetic energy is dissipated at much smaller scales in the turbulent boundary layers and in the ocean interior1, 2, where turbulent mixing controls the transport and storage of tracers such as heat and carbon dioxide3, 4. The primary site of wind power input is the Southern Ocean, where the westerly winds are aligned with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current5. The potential energy created here is converted into a vigorous geostrophic eddy field through baroclinic instabilities. The eddy energy can power mixing in the ocean interior6, 7, 8, but the mechanisms governing energy transfer to the dissipation scale are poorly constrained. Here we present simulations that simultaneously resolve meso- and submeso-scale motions as well as internal waves generated by topography in the Southern Ocean. In our simulations, more than 80{\%} of the wind power input is converted from geostrophic eddies to smaller-scale motions in the abyssal ocean. The conversion is catalysed by rough, small-scale topography. The bulk of the energy is dissipated within the bottom 100 m of the ocean, but about 20{\%} is radiated and dissipated away from topography in the ocean interior, where it can sustain turbulent mixing. We conclude that in the absence of rough topography, the turbulent mixing in the ocean interior would be diminished.},

abstract = {The difficulty of simulating a realistic Gulf Stream (GS) that separates from the coast at Cape Hatteras has troubled numerical ocean modelers for a long time, and the problem is evident in different models, from the early models of the 1980s to the modern models of today. The source of the problem is not completely understood yet, since GS simulations are sensitive to many different factors, such as numerical parameterization, model grid, treatment of topography and forcing fields. A curious result of early models is that models with terrain-following vertical grids (e.g., "sigma" or "s" coordinates) seem to achieve a better GS separation than z-level models of similar resolution, so the impact of the vertical grid type on GS simulations is revisited here. An idealized generalized coordinate numerical model is used to compare between a sigma-coordinate grid and a z-level grid while maintaining the same numerical code and model parameters. Short-term diagnostic-prognostic calculations focus on the initial dynamic adjustment of the GS from a given initial condition and imposed boundary conditions. In diagnostic calculations, wherein the three-dimensional flow field is adjusted to time-invariant temperature and salinity data, the GS is quite realistic independent of the grid type. However, when switching to prognostic calculations, the GS in the z-level model tends to immediately develop an unrealistic GS branch that continues along the continental slope instead of separating from the coast at Cape Hatteras. The GS is more realistic in either a sigma-coordinate model or in a z-level model with a vertical wall replacing the continental slope. Increasing the vertical resolution in the z-level model reduces numerical noise, but it does not solve the GS separation problem. Vorticity balance analysis shows that the Joint Effect of Baroclinicity and bottom Relief (JEBAR) and its associated bottom pressure torque are very sensitive to the choice of vertical grid. A stepped topography grid may disrupt the local vorticity balance near steep slopes; this vorticity balance may be important to develop a counterclockwise circulation north of the GS that pushes the GS offshore. Therefore, the study suggests that a smooth representation of bottom topography in ocean models by using either a terrain-following coordinates or a z-level grid with partial cells may allow a more realistic treatment of flow-topography interactions and potentially a better simulation of the GS.},

abstract = {Diagnostic calculations of the circulation in the North Atlantic are described. Three basic cases are considered: the climatological mean state and the circulation in the pentads 1955-1959 and 1970-1974. Density data from Levitus (1982, 1989) are used as input together with the annual mean wind stress field of Hellerman and Rosenstein (1983) for the climatological case and wind stress data derived from the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set for the 1950s and 1970s. The results suggest that the Gulf Stream was some 30 Sv weaker in the 1970-1974 pentad than in the pentad 1955-1959. About 20 Sv of this is due to a dramatic weakening of the circulation of the subtropical gyre. This is traced to a change in bottom pressure torque associated with the bottom topography on the western side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This same general area is also shown to be important for enhancing the transport of the climatological mean subtropical gyre above that predicted by the flat-bottomed Sverdrup relation. The remaining 10 Sv is due to a weakening of the cyclonic gyre in the continental slope region south of Atlantic Canada and north of the Gulf Stream. This too is associated with a change in bottom pressure torque. We find that changes in the density field above 1500 m depth contribute about half of the transport change. It is not clear how reliable is the estimate of the remaining half. This is because it is dependent on changes in the analyzed density field at depths greater than 1500 m, and these could be a result of insufficient or unreliable data. No significant change in the total transport of the subpolar gyre is diagnosed by our calculations. In order to interpret the results we have split the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief (JEBAR) term into two parts: a part associated with bottom pressure torque and a part associated with compensation by the density stratification for the effect of variable bottom topography. This leads to a natural division of the volume transport stream function {\ss} into three parts; • = • w + • c + • B. • w is calculated using wind forcing alone and assumes a uniform density ocean. • c is the difference between this and the stream function, • s, calculated using the flat-bottomed Sverdrup relation. It is driven by that part of JEBAR associated with density compensation. Finally, • B is the difference between {\ss} and {\ss} s and is that part of {\ss} driven by bottom pressure torque. (• c + • a) then gives the total contribution to • from the JEBAR term. We find that for the climatological mean subpolar gyre, density compensation is particularly important, with bottom pressure torque displacing the gyre southward rather then enhancing its transport. For the subtropical gyre, density compensation plays less of a role. Almost all the difference between the two pentads occurs in the bottom pressure torque part.},

Horizontal resolution is often cited as the main culprit due to poorly resolved small-scale variability whose upscale effects help to maintain blocks. However, recent studies show that blocking errors are also largely attributable to the large scale climatological bias of the model. Furthermore, modest resolution models can contain enough variability to generate greatly improved blocking frequency if they are corrected to account for time-mean bias. Here we show greatly improved simulations of Atlantic winter blocking frequency in a coupled ocean–atmosphere climate model. A reduction of the mean bias, due to an improved simulation of the Atlantic Ocean, is a key element of the improvement.},

abstract = {The mechanisms affecting the path of the depth-integrated North Atlantic western boundary current and the formation of the northern recirculation gyre are investigated using a hierarchy of models, namely, a robust diagnostic model, a prognostic model using a global 1° ocean general circulation model coupled to a two-dimensional atmospheric energy balance model with a hydrological cycle, a simple numerical baro-tropic model, and an analytic model. The results herein suggest that the path of this boundary current and the formation of the northern recirculation gyre are sensitive to both the magnitude of lateral viscosity and the strength of the deep western boundary current (DWBC). In particular, it is shown that bottom vortex stretching induced by a downslope DWBC near the south of the Grand Banks leads to the formation of a cyclonic northern recirculation gyre and keeps the path of the depth-integrated western boundary current downstream of Cape Hatteras separated from the North American coast. Both south of the Grand Banks and at the crossover region of the DWBC and Gulf Stream, the downslope DWBC induces strong bottom downwelling over the steep continental slope, and the magnitude of the bottom downwelling is locally stronger than surface Ekman pumping velocity, providing strong positive vorticity through bottom vortex-stretching effects. The bottom vortex-stretching effect is also present in an extensive area in the North Atlantic, and the contribution to the North Atlantic subpolar and subtropical gyres is on the same order as the local surface wind stress curl. Analytic solutions show that the bottom vortex stretching is important near the western boundary only when the continental slope is wider than the Munk frictional layer scale.},

abstract = {The classical problem of flow past a cylinder is revisited in the context of understanding two oceanographic phenomena: separation of the Gulf Stream from the North American coastline at Cape Hatteras and the interaction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with topographic obstacles. Numerical solutions are presented for eastward, barotropic flow past a cylinder in ab -plane channel. The solutions are dependent on two nondimensional parameters: the Reynolds number, Re, and a nondimensionalbparameter, . In line with previous studies,b ˆ increasing reduces the separation downstream of the cylinder but introduces a blocked stagnant region upstreamb ˆ of the cylinder, flanked by two inertial jets. The large limit is relevant to the interaction of the Antarcticb ˆ Circumpolar Current with topographic obstacles such as the Kerguelen Plateau. However, a new regime is obtained for high Reynolds number (Re.200) and moderatebparameter (;10–100) with two separatedb ˆ jetsdownstream of the cylinder. These jets can extend a considerable distance, maintained by breaking Rossby waves in the turbulent wake of the cylinder, within which there is a downscale cascade of vorticity and an upscale cascade of energy toward the Rhines scale. Through a series of numerical experiments, the authors demonstrate the relevance of this regime to the separation of a boundary current from a cape. The implications are that Gulf Stream separation at Cape Hatteras is the consequence ofboth the high Reynolds number in the ocean and the moderateb parameter associated with the curvature of the coastline at Cape Hatteras. Results also suggest that geostrophic eddy fluxes are essential in maintaining a tight separated jet},

abstract = {An overview is given of the semi-prognostic method, a new and novel technique that can be used for adjusting models to correct for systematic error. Applications of the method to a regional model of the northwest Atlantic Ocean, and to an eddy-permitting model of the entire North Atlantic, show improvement in the handling of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current systems, especially in the "northwest corner" region southeast of Newfoundland where prognostic models show systematic errors of as much as 10??C in the temperature field. Use of the semi-prognostic method also leads to improvement in the modelled flow over the eastern Canadian shelf. An advantage of the semi-prognostic method is that it is adiabatic; in particular, in spite of the improvement seen in the modelled hydrography, the potential temperature and salinity equations carried by the model are unchanged by the method. Rather, the method introduces a correction term to the horizontal momentum equations carried by the model. Adiabaticity ensures that the method does not compromise the requirement for the flow in the ocean interior to be primarily in the neutral tangent plane, and also ensures that the method is well-suited for tracer studies. The method is also easy to implement, requiring only an adjustment in the hydrostatic equation carried by the model. We also describe the use of the method as a diagnostic tool, for probing the important dynamic processes governing a phenomenon, and finally as a technique for transferring information between the different subcomponents of a nested modelling system. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
